When exporting the EPS from OmniGraffle

* Change the Export Area to "All Objects"
* Set the margin to 0 (no margin)

To make PNGs from EPS

* Go into ../images
* Open the eps with TexShop (assuming it is installed)
* TexShop will autovconvert and save as PDF
* Open PDF in preview and export as PNG - set DPI to 300
* Delete the PDF

Sadly, OmniGraffle's Export to PNG leaves an asymetric black border
and makes things look bad.
